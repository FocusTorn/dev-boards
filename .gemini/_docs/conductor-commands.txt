# Conductor: Gemini CLI Extension Reference

Conductor is a Context-Driven Development (CDD) extension for the Gemini CLI. It transforms the AI from a simple code generator into a proactive project manager that adheres to project-specific goals, architectural standards, and implementation plans.

## CORE COMMANDS REFERENCE

### 1. `/conductor:setup`
**High-Level Functionality:**
Initializes the Conductor environment by scaffolding a `conductor/` directory and guiding the user through defining the core "Single Source of Truth" for the project.

**Example Situations:**
- **Project Kickoff:** Starting a new (Greenfield) project and establishing the tech stack and product goals immediately.
- **Onboarding Existing Code:** Bringing Conductor into a mature (Brownfield) project to begin managed feature development.

**Notes:** Creates critical artifacts: `product.md`, `tech-stack.md`, `workflow.md`, and `product-guidelines.md`.

---

### 2. `/conductor:newTrack [description]`
**High-Level Functionality:**
Initializes a "Track" (a logical unit of work like a feature or bug fix). It forces the agent to create a detailed Specification (`spec.md`) and an actionable Implementation Plan (`plan.md`) before any code is touched.

**Example Situations:**
- **Feature Request:** "Add user authentication using JWT."
- **Bug Fix:** "Fix race condition in the serial port handler."

**Notes:** This command is the gateway to "Plan Before You Build." It ensures alignment between the user's intent and the agent's proposed path.

---

### 3. `/conductor:implement`
**High-Level Functionality:**
The primary execution command. It tasks the agent with following the `plan.md` created in the `newTrack` phase. The agent works through tasks sequentially, updates their status, and prompts for manual verification.

**Example Situations:**
- **Execution Phase:** After you have reviewed and approved a plan, you run this to let the AI start writing code and tests.

**Notes:** Implementations are tracked in `conductor/tracks.md`. The agent will typically pause for "Manual Validation" steps defined in the plan.

---

### 4. `/conductor:status`
**High-Level Functionality:**
Provides a high-level dashboard of the project's health and the status of all active and completed tracks.

**Example Situations:**
- **Progress Sync:** Checking which features are "In Progress," "Completed," or "Blocked."
- **Context Review:** Quickly seeing what the current active track is.

---

### 5. `/conductor:revert`
**High-Level Functionality:**
A git-aware revert command that understands the logical structure of Conductor work (tracks, phases, and tasks).

**Example Situations:**
- **Failed Implementation:** A task went wrong or introduced unexpected bugs, and you want to roll back to the state before the task (or the entire track) started.

---

## KEY PHILOSOPHY: CONTEXT-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (CDD)

- **Context as an Artifact:** Unlike standard AI interactions where context is lost in the chat history, Conductor stores it on disk in Markdown files.
- **Single Source of Truth:** Every interaction refers back to the `conductor/` directory, ensuring the AI never "forgets" your preferred coding style or library choices.
- **Safety & Review:** By separating "Planning" from "Implementation," you have a chance to catch architectural mistakes *before* code is generated.

---

## PERTINENT NOTES
- **Installation:** `gemini extensions install https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/conductor --auto-update`.
- **Token Usage:** Because Conductor manages and reads multiple context files, token consumption can be higher. Use `/stats model` to monitor this.
- **Git Integration:** Conductor relies heavily on Git for tracking changes and performing reverts.
