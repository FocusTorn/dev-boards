# Rust Agentic Skills: Gemini CLI Extension Reference

Rust Agentic Skills is a modular, constraint-based skill set designed for autonomous AI coding agents. It focuses on turning general-purpose LLMs into a disciplined Rust engineering team by providing specialized context, tools, and protocols tailored to the Rust ecosystem.

## CORE ARCHITECTURE (The Triad Pattern)

To maximize token efficiency and reliability, each skill is broken into three components:

1.  **Driver (`SKILL.md`):** Minimal metadata (triggers, execution phases) used by the agent to determine if the skill is relevant to the current task.
2.  **Tools (`scripts/`):** Deterministic executables (Shell, Rust binaries) that perform the actual work (e.g., linting, parsing, refactoring).
3.  **Context (`references/`):** Lazy-loaded documentation and "Dictionaries of Pain" (common pitfalls) that provide deep-dive knowledge only when needed.

## KEY FEATURES & CAPABILITIES

### 1. Agent Context Protocol (ACP) Compliance
**Functionality:**
Skills are self-describing, allowing agents to understand their own capabilities and the exact triggers that should activate specific workflows.

**Example Situations:**
- An agent detects a complex lifetime error and automatically activates the `Lint Hunter` skill to trace the reference.
- During project initialization, the agent uses the `Agent Router` to select the correct engineering sub-skills.

---

### 2. Research-Plan-Implement (RPI) Methodology
**Functionality:**
Enforces a strict workflow where the agent must research the codebase and plan its changes before writing any code.

**Example Situations:**
- Refactoring a core data structure: The agent first uses research tools to map dependencies, creates a migration plan, and only then begins implementation.

---

### 3. Specialized Rust Skills
**Functionality:**
Includes dedicated modules for various aspects of Rust development, such as:
- **Rust Core Specialist:** Idiomatic implementation and performance optimization.
- **Lint Hunter:** Debugging compiler errors and lifetime issues.
- **Pest/RON Specialists:** Domain-specific knowledge for grammar and serialization.
- **Security Specialist:** Auditing for `unsafe` code and potential vulnerabilities.

**Example Situations:**
- Resolving a `borrow checker` error that standard LLMs struggle with.
- Implementing a complex parser using the `pest` crate with guided expert instructions.

---

## USAGE & INTEGRATION

- **Gemini CLI:** Integrated as an extension where skills are discovered and activated via the `Agent Router`.
- **Manual Activation:** Skills can be manually loaded into any agent by providing the `SKILL.md` content as part of the prompt context.
- **Token Optimization:** By separating context into lazy-loaded files, it keeps the main conversation buffer clean and focused.

---

## PERTINENT NOTES
- **Multi-Agent Readiness:** Designed to support future "Beast Mode" where multiple skills can be chained autonomously without human intervention.
- **No-Dependency Focus:** Tools are designed to be as self-contained as possible to minimize environment setup friction.
