# Conductor Phase Integrity

## Governance & State Management

- PHASE TRANSITION BLOCKING GATE: Every phase transition within a `plan.md` MUST be treated as a strict, non-negotiable blocking event. 
- Upon completing the final task of Phase N, the agent MUST explicitly state 'Phase N is complete' and halt all execution immediately. 
- You are strictly FORBIDDEN from reading, parsing, planning, or mentioning any tasks from Phase N+1 until the user provides an explicit 'Proceed' message or equivalent approval. 
- This blocking gate is absolute and applies regardless of whether specific verification tasks are listed; the boundary between markdown headers (e.g., Phase 1 to Phase 2) is the primary trigger for this lock.
