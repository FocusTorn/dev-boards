# Conductor Process Rules

Standards for managing tracks and session transitions using the Conductor methodology.

## Track Management

- **Mandatory Branching**: Before starting a new track, ALWAYS create a dedicated branch named `track/<track_id>`. All implementation tasks must occur on this branch.
- **Pause Track Protocol**: When pausing work on a track, MUST follow the 'Pause Track Protocol' defined in `conductor/workflow.md`. This includes:
    - Synchronizing the implementation plan (`plan.md`).
    - Updating metadata timestamps.
    - Creating a Handover Note (`NOTES.md`) with explicit 'Next Action' context.
    - Performing a Checkpoint Commit on the track branch.
- **Resume Branch Protocol**: When resuming work, verify the current active branch matches `track/<track_id>`. If the tree is dirty on the wrong branch, commit it as a checkpoint before switching.

### Phase Boundary Hard Gate
- **NEVER** initiate a task from Phase N+1 until Phase N has been officially closed.
- **MANDATORY PAUSE**: When the last functional task of a Phase is marked complete, you MUST stop and execute the 'Phase Completion & Checkpointing' protocol from `workflow.md`.
- **USER APPROVAL**: You MUST explicitly present the Phase results and wait for user approval before modifying the `plan.md` to start Phase N+1.
