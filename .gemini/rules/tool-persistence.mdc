# Tool Usage Standards

Standards for tool selection, persistence, and error recovery to ensure maximum efficiency and accuracy.

## Preferred Tool Persistence

- **OPTIMIZED SEARCH**: `search_file_content` is the MANDATORY first choice for all codebase-wide searches.
- **ERROR RECOVERY**: If a tool call fails with a syntax, regex, or usage error, you MUST analyze the error message and attempt at least one corrected call before pivoting to a less efficient tool (like `read_file` or manual shell commands).
- **CLOSED LOOP**: If a tool provides optimization suggestions (e.g., '--multiline' or '--fixed-strings'), you MUST consider and apply them if they align with the task objective.
