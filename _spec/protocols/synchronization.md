## SYNCHRONIZATION
**PROTOCOL: Update project-level docs.**

1.  **Analyze:** Compare the completed track's **Specification** with the **Product Definition**, **Tech Stack**, and **Product Guidelines**.
2.  **Propose:** If changes are needed, present them in diff format for approval.
3.  **Update:** Only after user confirmation, edit the project files.
4.  **Report:** Announce completion and commit with `docs(_spec): Synchronize docs for track '<track_description>'`.
