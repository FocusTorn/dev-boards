## INTERRUPTIONS
**PROTOCOL: Handle out-of-scope requests.**

1.  **Scope Awareness:** If a request is outside the track's documentation:
    a. **Acknowledge:** Note that it is outside the current track's scope.
    b. **Fulfill:** Address the request using general tools.
    c. **Confirm Before Resuming:** Once addressed, ask: "I have addressed your request. Would you like to resume working on the track '<track_description>'? (yes/no)"
2.  **Wait for Approval:** Only proceed with the track if the user approves.
