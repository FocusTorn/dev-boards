# Progress Notes: `hardening_coverage_20260128`

## Context
Resumed work from `testing_100_coverage_20260128` with a focus on granular task execution and enforcing GitBash/Unix standards to prevent file corruption.

## Open Issues
- `Generating` stage detection failing in `compile_parser.rs`.
- `smooth_scrollbar.rs` has significant coverage gaps (~45%).
- `HistoryManager` needs robust error recovery tests.
