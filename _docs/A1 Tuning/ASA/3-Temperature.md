# Step 3: Temperature (General)
**Goal:** Find the "Sweet Spot" where layer adhesion is strongest and stringing is minimal.

## Why this matters for ASA
ASA has a broad printing range (240°C - 270°C). 
*   **Too Cold:** Matte finish, weak layer bonding (delamination), and clogs.
*   **Too Hot:** Excessive stringing, drooping overhangs, and "cooked" filament smell.

## Procedure (Orca Slicer)
1.  Go to **Calibration** -> **Temperature Tower**.
2.  **Select Material:** ASA.
3.  **Range:** 240°C to 260°C (A1 Max).
4.  Print the tower.
5.  **The "Break Test":** Once cooled, try to snap the tower with your hands. Pick the temperature where the tower is hardest to break. 
6.  **Visual Check:** Look for the section with the clearest text and sharpest corners.

## Showcase Tip
If two temperatures look identical, pick the **higher** one. Higher temperatures provide better "welding" between layers, which is crucial for the structural integrity of ASA parts.
