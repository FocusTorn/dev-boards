# # Git Feature Branch Workflow Summary

# ## Workflow Steps

# 1. Ensure Working Branch is Clean
#     - Checkout main/master branch: `git checkout main`
#     - Fetch latest changes: `git fetch origin`
#     - Sync with remote: `git pull origin main`
#     - Verify clean state: `git status` (no uncommitted changes)

# 2. Create Feature Branch
#     - Create and switch to new branch: `git checkout -b feature/enhancement-name`
#     - Use descriptive naming: `feature/add-new-feature` or `enhancement/improve-performance`

# 3. Work on Enhancement
#     - Make changes and commit as you work
#     - Main branch remains unchanged and protected
#     - Commit frequently: `git add .` then `git commit -m "Add enhancement: description"`

# 4. Optional: Push Feature Branch to Remote
#     - Push for backup/collaboration: `git push -u origin feature/enhancement-name`
#     - Allows others to review or you to access from different machines

# 5. Merge Enhancement Back When Complete
#     - Switch to main: `git checkout main`
#     - Merge feature branch: `git merge feature/enhancement-name`
#     - Push merged changes: `git push origin main`

# 6. Optional: Clean Up Feature Branch
#     - Delete local branch: `git branch -d feature/enhancement-name`
#     - Delete remote branch: `git push origin --delete feature/enhancement-name`

# ---

# ## Benefits

# 1. Safe Development
#     - Main branch stays stable and deployable
#     - Working model remains untouched
#     - Easy to abandon enhancement if needed (just delete branch)

# 2. Collaboration Features
#     - Easy comparison: `git diff main..feature/enhancement-name`
#     - Can create Pull Requests for review
#     - Multiple developers can work on different features simultaneously

# 3. Flexibility
#     - Switch between branches easily
#     - Work on multiple enhancements in parallel
#     - Keep enhancement work isolated from production code

# ---

# ## Quick Reference Commands

# 1. Branch Management
#     - List local branches: `git branch`
#     - List all branches (including remote): `git branch -a`
#     - Show current branch: `git branch --show-current`
#     - Switch branches: `git checkout branch-name`

# 2. Comparison and Status
#     - See differences: `git diff main..feature/enhancement-name`
#     - Check working tree status: `git status`
#     - View commit history: `git log --oneline --graph --all`

# 3. Branch Operations
#     - Create new branch: `git checkout -b feature/new-name`
#     - Delete local branch: `git branch -d branch-name`
#     - Delete remote branch: `git push origin --delete branch-name`
