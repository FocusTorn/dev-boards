# Mechanical Calibration & Maintenance

## The "Axis Health" Checklist
1. **Belt Tension:** Use a frequency app or a tension gauge. For most CoreXY, 110Hz-150Hz on X/Y belts is standard.
2. **Eccentric Nuts:** Wheels should be tight enough to not spin freely, but loose enough to turn with two fingers.
3. **Z-Axis:** Clean leadscrews and check for "Z-wobble" (periodic patterns on the vertical walls).

## First Layer Success
1. **Z-Offset:** The distance between the nozzle and the bed at Z=0. 
2. **Tramming (Leveling):** Ensure the bed is equidistant from the nozzle at all corners.
3. **Bed Cleanliness:** 99% IPA or warm water + Dawn dish soap.
