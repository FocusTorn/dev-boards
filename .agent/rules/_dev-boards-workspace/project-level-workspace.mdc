# Dev-Boards Project-Level Workspace Rules

## **CRITICAL EXECUTION DIRECTIVE**

**AI Agent Directive**: Follow dev-boards project-level workspace rules exactly for all dev-boards-specific workspace configuration tasks.

**MANDATORY EXECUTION PROTOCOL**:

1. **NO DEVIATION**: All project-level workspace rules must be followed exactly as written
2. **NO SKIPPING**: No steps may be skipped, abbreviated, or modified
3. **NO SELECTIVE COMPLIANCE**: All rules apply to all dev-boards workspace configuration activities
4. **FAILURE TO COMPLY**: Violating these rules constitutes a critical protocol violation

## **PACKAGE MANAGER PREFERENCE**

### **UV as Preferred Python Package Manager**

**✅ CORRECT - UV is the preferred Python package manager for dev-boards projects**:

- UV is the preferred package manager for all Python projects in the dev-boards workspace
- All workspace configuration should use UV (see `tool/uv/workspace.mdc` for UV workspace rules)
- When package management is needed, UV should be used instead of pip when available

**Reference**: See `tool/uv/workspace.mdc` for complete UV workspace configuration rules and patterns.

## **ANTI-PATTERNS**

### **❌ Dev-Boards Configuration Violations**

- ❌ **Using Decommissioned Projects** - Don't reference decommissioned projects in examples
- ❌ **Completed Package References** - Don't reference completed/singular-instance packages in generic examples
- ❌ **Project-Specific in Global Rules** - Don't put dev-boards-specific paths or packages in global workspace rules
- ❌ **Ignoring UV Preference** - Don't use pip when UV is available and appropriate

## **QUALITY GATES**

- [ ] **UV Preference**: UV is used as the preferred Python package manager
- [ ] **No Decommissioned References**: No references to decommissioned projects
- [ ] **No Completed Package References**: No references to completed/singular-instance packages in examples
- [ ] **Proper Separation**: Dev-boards-specific content is in project-level rules, not global rules

## **SUCCESS METRICS**

After implementing proper dev-boards workspace configuration:

- ✅ **UV Usage** - UV is used as the preferred package manager
- ✅ **Clean Separation** - Project-specific content separated from global rules
- ✅ **No Legacy References** - No references to decommissioned projects or completed packages
- ✅ **Maintainable Structure** - Easy to update project-specific examples as projects change
